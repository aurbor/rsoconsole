# RSO Console

*Description*

This is my first attempt at using react-admin to create an admin panel for some meaningful use. I am hoping to interpret data from CSV format from RealitySportsOnline NFL fantasy football, and apply some logic on it to help with player decisions - salary, contract length, potential trades, free agents, etc.
